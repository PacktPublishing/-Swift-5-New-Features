If you are already a Swift programmer, this course will get you up-to-date with all the new features in Swift 5 to improve your productivity and efficiency.
You will become fully acquainted with the new String ergonomics and improvements to the current Swift Standard Library, and discover some new examples of syntactical sugar that will let you write shorter but more powerful code. You will learn about the new result type for handling errors, thereby making your code more robust. Finally, you will learn how to migrate to Swift 5 as easily as possible.
By the end of the course, you will have gained up-to-date insights into all of Swift 5's features and will be able to code efficiently and rapidly within your projects.
